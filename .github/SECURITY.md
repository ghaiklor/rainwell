# Security Policy

As game is currently in its early development phase, we have limited security measures in place:

- Only the latest commit on the main branch is actively maintained
- We provide security updates and patches exclusively for the most recent version
- No historical versions are supported at this time

Please note that comprehensive security policies will be implemented as the game matures in development.
